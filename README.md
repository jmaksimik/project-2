# TunedIn - A MongoDB CRUD App
## About the App
TunedIn is an app where people can create and share playlists with each other. By logging in via Google authorization, users can customize playlists, which will be available for others to view and take inspiration from. 
The interface was designed with simplicity in mind, so users can easily learn how to use the site through exploration.
The app is currently being hosted on Cyclic.
